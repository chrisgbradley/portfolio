## About

A repository for my public portfolio.

I'm a software developer that is moving over from from doing software field service. I like working in Go and occasionally dabble in C#, Rust, Python, and TypeScript, depending on the project.

## Status

- [x] Go HTTP server
- [x] Intro added and styled
- [x] Project YAML -> HTMX added
- [ ] Docker Setup
- [ ] Server Built
- [ ] CI/CD for future updates

## Projects

Tracking for projects that I have completed, am currently working on, and plan to start in the near future. There is no rhyme or reason to the project order and it's just something for me to pick from as I progress. As I complete the projects, I will check them off, add a link to the github repository, and update the portfolio `/data/projects.yaml`.
